    <h2 id="who">Who am I?</h2>
    <p class="text">
      I am a senior studying Computer Science at UC Irvine in Southern California (graduating Spring 2024).
      I am specializing in articifical intelligence and hope to use my acquired skills
      to become a successful and important part of the tech workforce after I graduate.
      My hobbies include competing in gaming tournaments, programming, and spending time with
      my girlfriend.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      Scroll further down below to view some of the projects I have completed as hobbies.
      While I have completed a multitude of small programming projects for various classes
      throughout my time at college, I feel these projects do a better job of representing
      my interests.

    <h2 id="future">Future Projects</h2>
    <p class="text">
      I don't want to give away too many details about my future projects,
      but I will say I have two planned.
      One involves creating a helpful Google Chrome extension involving YouTube
      videos and online content creators. The other involves a new
      <abbr title="Super Smash Bros. Melee">SSBM</abbr> modification, which involves
      overhauling many of <abbr title="Super Smash Bros. Melee">SSBM</abbr>'s features.
      Features including memory management, graphics, models, animations, stages, characters,
      music, and much more. View the images below for a sneak peak.
